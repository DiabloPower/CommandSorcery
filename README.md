# 🧙‍♂️ CommandSorcery
A growing arsenal of command-line spells — crafted for automation, diagnostics, and everyday CLI enchantments. CommandSorcery is a modular Bash launcher ([sorcery.sh](./sorcery.sh)) that orchestrates remote scripts with full GUI and CLI support. It acts as a central gateway to your toolset: self-updating, interface-flexible, and extensible via registry.

## 🚀 Launcher: [sorcery.sh](./sorcery.sh)
The heart of the system. This script lets you select and execute any registered tool — either interactively via GUI or directly via command-line.

### ✨ Features
- 🧠 Auto-detects best available UI (YAD, Zenity, Dialog, CLI)
- 🪄 GUI-based script selection if no arguments are passed
- 🔄 Self-updating via GitHub (--update-self)
- 🛡️ Safe update logic with backup and HTTP check
- 🧾 Help overview via --help
- 🧰 Registry-based architecture for easy extensibility

### 🧾 Usage
```bash
./sorcery.sh [SCRIPT] [OPTIONS]
```
Examples
```bash
./sorcery.sh gutenberg --yad --no-open
./sorcery.sh convert --batch --cli
./sorcery.sh --update-self
```
If no script is specified, a GUI menu will appear (based on available interface tools).

## 📜 Registered Scripts

### [`gutenberg.sh`](./gutenberg.sh): 

A shell script for fetching, organizing, and exporting books from [Projekt Gutenberg-DE](https://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/) as polished PDFs.

### 🧙‍♂️ Interface Options:

This script supports multiple user interfaces:

- 🖥️ CLI (Command Line)
- 🪟 Dialog
- 🪄 Zenity
- 🧿 YAD

The interface can be selected automatically based on availability, or manually via command-line override.

### 🧾 Usage:

To view all available options and usage instructions, simply run:

```bash
./gutenberg.sh --help
```

### 🧰 Core Dependencies

These tools are essential for the script to function properly. If missing, they will be automatically installed via apt (with sudo):

- wget – for downloading web pages and files
- pandoc – for converting text formats (e.g., Markdown to PDF)
- lynx – for parsing and extracting text from HTML
- pdflatex – for generating PDFs via LaTeX (used by Pandoc)

### 🧩 Optional GUI Dependencies

These are only installed if explicitly requested via:

```bash
--install-if-missing=yad
```

Available options:

- yad – graphical form and live log window
- zenity – entry dialogs and progress spinner
- dialog – text-based UI for terminal environments

---

## [`ffmpeg-convert-mkv.sh`](./ffmpeg-convert-mkv.sh):

A flexible shell script for converting video files with FFmpeg including single-file and batch directory conversion, supporting hardware acceleration (NVENC) and multiple user interfaces. It accepts virtually any input format (e.g. AVI, MP4, MOV) and re-encodes the video using H.265 — either via libx265 or NVENC if available — while converting audio to AAC. The output container is determined by the file extension you specify, such as .mkv, .mp4, or others.

### 🎛️ Interface Options:

This script supports multiple user interfaces:

- 🖥️ CLI (Command Line)
- 🪟 Dialog
- 🪄 Zenity
- 🧿 YAD

The interface can be selected manually via command-line flags, or defaults to YAD if available.

### 🧾 Usage:

To view all available options and usage instructions, simply run:

```bash
./ffmpeg-convert-mkv.sh --help
```

### 🧰 Core Dependencies

ffmpeg – required for video conversion (automatically installed via apt if missing)

### 🧩 Optional GUI Dependencies

These are only installed if explicitly requested via:

```bash
--install-if-missing=yad
```

Available options:

- yad – graphical form and live log window
- zenity – entry dialogs and progress spinner
- dialog – text-based UI for terminal environments

### ⚡ Hardware Acceleration

If NVIDIA NVENC is available, the script will use hevc_nvenc for faster encoding. Otherwise, it falls back to libx265.

### 🗂️ Batch Mode

This script now supports a powerful batch mode for converting entire directories of video files. You can activate it via:

```bash
--batch
```
When enabled, the script will prompt for input and output directories (via GUI or CLI), then process all supported video formats in one go. It includes:

- ✅ Automatic format detection
- ✅ Live progress display (YAD)
- ✅ Summary of successful, failed, and skipped conversions
- ✅ Safety check to prevent overwriting input files

## 🧙‍♂️ Development Notes

This project was developed and tested on a Debian-based system (Zorin OS 17.3). The scripts attempt to install their required dependencies automatically via apt, if missing.

## 🧠 Remote Execution from GitHub
You can run these scripts directly from GitHub using curl or wget without downloading them manually. This is useful for quick usage, automation, or testing across multiple systems.

### 🧾 Example: Run sorcery.sh directly
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiabloPower/CommandSorcery/main/sorcery.sh)
bash <(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiabloPower/CommandSorcery/main/sorcery.sh)
```
You can pass any flags as usual, for example:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiabloPower/CommandSorcery/main/sorcery.sh) convert --batch --yad
```

⚠️ Note: This requires internet access and assumes the script is compatible with your system. Core Dependencies will be installed automatically if missing (via apt).
